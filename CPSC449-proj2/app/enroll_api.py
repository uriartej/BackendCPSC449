# The API should allow students to:
#  - List available classes (/courses)
#  - Attempt to enroll in a class
#  - Drop a class
#
# Instructors should be able to:
#  - View current enrollment for their classes (/users/1/enrollments)
#  - View students who have dropped the class (/users/1/enrollments?status=Dropped)
#  - Drop students administratively (e.g. if they do not show up to class)
#
# The registrar should be able to:
#  - Add new classes and sections
#  - Remove existing sections
#  - Change the instructor for a section
